# ⚡ 0.2.0

* Switch from supporting the Lambda `python3.6` runtime to a new ✨ `rust` runtime ✨ ( which runs on the `provided` runtime under the covers )
* you can now deploy independent functions with `npx serverless deploy function -f func-name`
* you no longer have to be explicit about function binary to include, this plugin generates and configures the artifact (zip) file for you
* you no longer have to set default exclusion rules
* you can deploy a `rust` runtime function side by side with other serverless runtime functions
within the same service, to facilitate experimentation and learning.
